This documentation describes the Synopsys Seeker IAST Service Broker for VMware Tanzu. Synopsys Seeker IAST Service
Broker for VMware Tanzu enables developers to add interactive application security testing (IAST) in VMware Tanzu deployments. Synopsys Seeker gives
unparalleled visibility into your web app security posture and identifies vulnerability trends against compliance standards,
for example, OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS, and CWE/SANS.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Synopsys Seeker IAST Service Broker for VMware Tanzu registers a service broker with VMware Tanzu and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Synopsys Seeker service instance and binding it to an app allows the Seeker agent to be
deployed with your VMware Tanzu app during deployment. The Seeker agent uses instrumentation techniques and runtime
analysis to continuously monitor, identify, and verify security vulnerabilities in web apps.

Typically, Seeker analysis is executed during the test or QA stage of the software development life cycle.
